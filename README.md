# Basic gRPC Demo Implementation (.NET Core)
This simple implementation was created during my process of learning gRPC as well as C#.

-The intial basic implementation served to basically establish a connection and greet the user.
-This is a more relevant implementation of a gRPC service because it is created in ASP.NET Core, instead of Grpc.Core.
