# Basic gRPC Demo Implementation
This simple implementation was created during my process of learning gRPC as well as C#.

-For those other than me that are viewing this, feel free to ignore some comments I write as those were made to help me understand and remember things. 
They are not reflective of how I would comment in production.

-The intial basic implementation (commented out in GrpcClient/Program.cs) served to basically establish a connection and greet the user.
